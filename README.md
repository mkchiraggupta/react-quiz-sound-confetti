# react-quiz-sound-confetti
Through this project, I have implemented confetti animations and sound effects to enhance the user experience on the UI. I created a quiz where selecting a wrong answer triggers a loss sound, while selecting the correct answer plays a win sound and also shows confetti bursting from the submit button.
